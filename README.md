## Description

The Sprut Forex Software is a grid-based trading system developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It analyzes market data and generates trading signals based on the grid method, partial closing, and hedging strategies.

## Code Overview

The code consists of several functions and event handlers:

### Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. It sets the time frame for analysis and trading signals as M15, defines the currency pairs to trade, and sets the number of currency pairs. It also sets the timer to analyze market data and generate trading signals every 15 minutes.

### Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the Expert Advisor is deinitialized. It stops analyzing market data and generating trading signals. This function is responsible for cleaning up any resources used by the Expert Advisor.

### Expert Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the price. It calls the `AnalyzeMarketData()` function to analyze market data and generate trading signals. It then calls the `ExecuteTrades()` function to execute trades based on the generated signals.

### Analyze Market Data Function

The `AnalyzeMarketData()` function implements the logic to analyze market data and generate trading signals. It utilizes the grid method, partial closing, and hedging strategies to generate these signals.

### Execute Trades Function

The `ExecuteTrades()` function implements the logic to open and close positions based on the grid method. It executes trades based on the generated signals.

### Event Function

The `OnTimer()` function is called when the timer set in the `OnInit()` function triggers. It calls the `AnalyzeMarketData()` function to analyze market data and generate trading signals.
